        question: "What is the SI unit of power of a lens?",
        options: ["Dioptre", "Volt", "Watt", "Newton"],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The SI unit of power of a lens is dioptre, which is equal to the reciprocal of focal length in meters."
    },
    {
        question: "Which mirror always produces a virtual, erect and diminished image?",
        options: ["Concave mirror", "Convex mirror", "Plane mirror", "Spherical mirror"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A convex mirror always produces a virtual, erect and diminished image regardless of the position of the object."

    {
        question: "The refractive index of water is 1.33. What does this mean?",
        options: [
            "Light travels 1.33 times faster in water than in vacuum",
            "Light travels 1.33 times slower in water than in vacuum",
            "Water is 1.33 times denser than air",
            "Light bends 1.33 degrees when entering water"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Refractive index indicates how much light slows down in a medium compared to vacuum. A refractive index of 1.33 means light travels 1.33 times slower in water than in vacuum."

    {
        question: "What is the focal length of a plane mirror?",
        options: ["Zero", "Infinity", "Equal to the object distance", "Equal to the image distance"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A plane mirror can be considered as a spherical mirror with an infinite radius of curvature, hence its focal length is infinity."

    {
        question: "Which phenomenon is responsible for the twinkling of stars?",
        options: ["Reflection", "Refraction", "Atmospheric refraction", "Dispersion"],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "The twinkling of stars is due to atmospheric refraction, where starlight undergoes continuous refraction as it passes through layers of air with varying densities."
